This project is an enhanced Snake game using Java Swing and AWT, incorporating key features that elevate the gameplay experience.🎮🐍

Here are some highlights of the game:

1)Arrow Key Movement ⬅️➡️⬆️⬇️: Intuitive control of the snake using arrow keys ensures smooth and responsive gameplay.

2)Wall Wrapping : The snake seamlessly moves off one side of the screen and reappears on the other, creating an endless playing field.

3)Red Apple Growth 🍎: When the snake eats a red apple, it grows in length, and the player earns score.

4)Green Apple Shrink 🍏: Consuming green apples reduces both the snake's length and score, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

5)Dynamic Speed Increase ⚡: As players advance, the snake’s speed increases, providing a greater challenge.

6)Level Advancement 📈: Players progress through levels as their score reaches multiples of 10, with difficulty increasing at each stage.

7)Score Display 📊: The score is prominently displayed at the top of the screen.

8)Self-Collision and Game Restart 💥: If the snake collides with itself, the game ends, but players can restart instantly by pressing any key.

These features bring added complexity, strategy, and replayability to the classic Snake game, making it both challenging and fun.🔥
