Key Features of the Game:-
Arrow Key Movement: The snake is controlled using the arrow keys, providing intuitiveand responsive gameplay.

Wall Wrapping: The snake seamlessly passes through one side of the screen and reappears on the opposite side, offering an endless playing field and adding a unique challenge to navigation.

Red Apple Growth: When the snake consumes a red apple, its length increases, and the score increments accordingly. This rewards the player for careful movement and planning.

Green Apple Shrink: Eating a green apple decreases both the snake’s length and score, introducing a strategic element where players must avoid these apples to maintain progress.

Dynamic Speed Increase: As the player progresses through levels, the snake’s speed gradually increases, testing the player's reflexes and adding excitement to the game.

Level Advancement: Levels increase once the player’s score reaches multiples of 10,adding milestones that signal the player's progress and increasing the game’s difficulty.

Self-Collision and Game Restart: The game ends when the snake collides with itself, but players are given the option to restart by pressing any key, allowing them to jump back into the action quickly.

These features enhance the traditional Snake game by adding complexity, strategy, and replayability.
